        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m Logan Schuler, an Information Science major with a minor in Economics at Michigan State University. I enjoy digging into data, solving problems, and finding clear, efficient ways to organize information. My work experience ranges from managing sensitive financial records at Jackson National Life to supporting day-to-day operations in customer-facing environments, giving me a strong mix of analytical and people-focused skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a quick learner, adaptable, and not afraid to take on new responsibilities. Whether I’m working with SQL, building dashboards, helping clients, or keeping a facility running smoothly, I show up ready to work hard and improve every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not working or studying, I’m usually doing something active. I love playing sports, staying in shape, and finding new ways to push myself physically. Whether it’s baseball, basketball, or just getting outside to train, sports have always been a big part of my routine and a great way for me to recharge and have fun.
