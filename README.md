# MI349 Final Project — Professional Portfolio

This repo contains a small responsive portfolio website (4 HTML pages + 1 CSS) ready for deployment on Netlify.

## Files
- `index.html` — homepage with hero + featured work
- `about.html` — bio, skills, education
- `portfolio.html` — projects grid
- `contact.html` — contact form (static)
- `css/styles.css` — single stylesheet using the Slate & Emerald palette
- `images/` — add exported images from your Figma file here (e.g. `images/photo1.jpg`, `images/photo2.jpg`, `images/hero.jpg`)

## How to use
1. Put all files in a folder and initialize a git repo.
2. Ensure `css/styles.css` is at `css/styles.css` and images are in `images/`.
3. Open `index.html` in the browser to preview locally.
4. Push to GitHub and connect to Netlify as described in the assignment.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder text and images with your real content.
- Validate HTML using the W3C validator if required.
